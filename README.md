### What is this?
Meteor Blocks is a demonstration of 3D rendering in response to changes in a database. Using normal Meteor templates and a DOM-to-3D library, we can make a collaborative 3D scene editor with a surprisingly small amount of code.

As browser-based 3D becomes easier and more powerful, it will be possible to make even more complex apps that combine the expressiveness and convenience of web development with the immersiveness of 3D.

### What technologies does this use?
- [X3DOM](http://www.x3dom.org/) is a way to represent 3D scenes in the DOM.
- [Meteor](http://meteor.com) makes it easy to update the DOM in reaction to changes in data.
Looks like they could be meant for each other!

### Check out the simple version
[The simple branch](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-x3dom-demo/tree/simple) has a version of the code which is focused on the core mechanics of adding, removing, and rendering blocks without all of the features to make a real app. Check this out if you want to see how everything works. You can also look at this app live at [simple3d.meteor.com](http://simple3d.meteor.com).
